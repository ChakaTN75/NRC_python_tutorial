# NRC_python_tutorial
Examples and slides from a python best practices tutorial at the NRC. I will be covering:

1. Virtual environments
2. Packaging code
3. Coding best practices (PEP8 and pylint)
4. Error handling
5. Logging

People might want to install Pycharm. They don't have to but it's a decent IDE and it might be useful to have similar environments. 

Download the community edition from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux 

Then run: 
    
    $ tar -zxvf pycharm-community-2016.1.4.tar.gz
    $ cd pycharm-community-2016.1.4/bin
    $ ./pycharm.sh
